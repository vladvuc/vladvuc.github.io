Once upon a midnight eerie, amidst a room dim and dreary,  
I found myself engaged in a game, a curious endeavor, Qwixx by name.  
With dice in hand, I sat alone, the shadows dancing, as if they'd flown,  
And in that darkness, I began to play, within a world where time held sway.  

The game unfolded, a simple design, yet with a twist that defied my mind.  
For as the dice were cast and rolled, their numbers spoke, a tale untold.  
With every choice, a risk was made, a sacrifice to be duly paid,  
For Qwixx, you see, was a merciless game, where decisions held both fortune and shame.  

In the distance, a clock struck twelve, its chime echoing within the knell,  
And as the minutes slowly passed, I sought victory, but shadows amassed.  
The rows and columns, a labyrinth of fate, where one wrong move could seal my state.  
Each cross and mark, a pact with doom, an ill-fated dance in this dim-lit room.  

The numbers taunted, with their silent call, tempting me to rise or fall.  
But caution whispered in my ear, as whispers of the night drew near.  
In each move, I glimpsed the unknown, a glimpse of what my fate had sown.  
Would I triumph, or be undone, by Qwixx's game, where darkness won?  

The ink upon the score sheet grew, marking choices, both false and true,  
And as the game neared its fateful end, I wondered what fate would comprehend.  
The final dice, they tumbled free, and sealed my fate eternally,  
For Qwixx, in its twisted design, had left me at the mercy of time.  

The last cross made, my heart did race, a moment suspended, in empty space,  
And as the final score was shown, I realized I was not alone.  
For in this room, where shadows loomed, a presence lingered, foreboding, doomed.  
Qwixx had drawn me to this abyss, where Edgar Allan Poe's spirit did persist.  

And so I left that haunted place, a ghostly memory, an eerie trace,  
For Qwixx, in its macabre allure, had woven a tale, somber and pure.  
Though I escaped that room of dread, the whispers of Poe still filled my head,  
Reminding me, in each twist and turn, that games of chance can leave souls to burn.
